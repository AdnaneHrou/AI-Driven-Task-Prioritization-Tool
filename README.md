# AI-Driven-Task-Prioritization-Tool
An AI-based tool to optimize task prioritization in IT project management by dynamically adjusting task rankings based on urgency, resource availability, and deadlines.
# AI-Driven Task Prioritization Tool for IT Project Management

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an **AI-Driven Task Prioritization Tool** aimed at optimizing task management in IT project environments. By leveraging machine learning, the tool automates the process of prioritizing tasks based on real-time data, such as resource availability, urgency, and project deadlines. 

### Key Features:
- **Automated Task Prioritization:** Dynamically adjusts task rankings as conditions evolve.
- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Continuously updates prioritization based on new data.
- **User Feedback Loop:** Learns and improves based on user inputs.
- **Scalable Design:** Can be adapted to various projects and industries.
- **Efficient Resource Allocation:** Helps project managers optimize resource usage and avoid bottlenecks.

### Objectives
The primary objective is to reduce the manual workload on project managers by automating the task prioritization process using AI. This tool is expected to enhance efficiency, reduce human error, and improve overall project outcomes.

### Scope of the Project
This project covers:
- Developing a machine learning algorithm for task prioritization.
- Designing an intuitive UI for end-users (project managers).
- Integration of real-time project data to continuously update task priorities.
- Testing and evaluation of the AI model.

### Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Front-end Tools:** Figma, Sketch for UI/UX design
- **Project Management Tools:** Monday.com, Jira
